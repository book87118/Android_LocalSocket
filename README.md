# Android_LocalSocket


===========================
This is a demo for LocalSocket in Android
In this project, I used [LocalSocket](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/LocalSocket.html) and [LocalSocketServer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/LocalServerSocket.html)both.
They would communicate eath other and show their reasults into Main UI
